## Encoder v1.0
### Introduction
Encoder is a Java program for data encoding and decoding without loss of information. 

In particular, it is possible:

- Encode a file using the Run Length encoding algorithm (optimized with flag);
- Encode a file using the LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) encoding algorithm;
- Unzip a previously compressed file using the decompression function of one of the two algorithms (it will be chosen automatically).

For more information, see Release Notes.

### Usage
You can run the program:

- Starting the executable JAR file;
- Or by compiling and running the code from a terminal or any Java compatible IDE.

For a more detailed guide, see Installation Notes.

### Operation of the program
Its operation is divided into 3 steps:

- First of all, press the "Open" button (on the right), in order to start the file manager, through which you can choose the file that most interests you to compress or decompress;
- Then select between three possible modes: RunLength encoding, LZW encoding, decoding;
- Finally press the start button (called "coding" or "decoding") and wait for the upload to finish. When finished, the destination directory will appear on the screen.
